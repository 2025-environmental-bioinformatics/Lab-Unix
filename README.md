## Lesson 2: Basic Unix command and Introduction to WHOI's HPC

### Review
**Last time we: **
1. Opened the terminal on our local machine
2. Talked about file / folder structures
3. Tested out some  commands for navigating around our file structures via the command line and figuring out who we are:
        - `ls`: list files in current location
        - `pwd`: print working directory (where am I?)
        - `cd`: change directory (moving from place to place)


### Goals for today: 
**Today we will:**
1. Get an introduction to HPCs in general and the HPC we will be using for this class (`poseidon.whoi.edu`) 
2. Discuss remote machine access (`ssh`) and log on to the HPC
3. Review the commands we learned at the end of last class 
4. Review wildcards and regex
5. Review outputs & string commands together
6. Review scripts


## Logging on to the HPC
For this class (and all subsequent classes) we will be using WHOI's HPC: `poseidon.whoi.edu`. This is a remote cluster of computers (it isn't really *that* remote; it is in the basement of Clark). Nearly all command line systems (BASH etc.) have Secure Shell (`ssh`) natively installed. `ssh` is a cryptographic network protocol that allows you to provides a secure channel over an unsecured network. `ssh` can be used to log on to any number of platforms such as: remote computers (like a lab computer), computer clusters or high performance computers (HPCs), computers running in the cloud (e.g. AWS), etc. 

Today we will be using `ssh` to logon to `poseidon.whoi.edu`. To do this you will need to know what your WHOI username is and be within WHOI's firewall either by connecting to the local network (e.g. `eduroam`) or by logging into WHOI's vpn. 

Once you are logged on to WHOI's network you should be ready to `ssh`. In your terminal prompt type the following: 

```bash
ssh username@poseidon.whoi.edu
``` 
If this is your first time logging onto the network you will see a prompt like the following: 

``` text 
	Host key not found from the list of known hosts.
	Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? 
```
This is a safety protocol ensuring that you do indeed want to add this address to a list of known hosts. Type `yes`. 

You should now be prompted for your password (this will be your WHOI email password): 
``` text 
Host 'poseidon.whoi.edu' added to the list of known hosts.
      [usernames]'s password:
```
Once you type the correct password you should see something like the following:
```text
  ___             _    _             ___ _         _           
 | _ \___ ___ ___(_)__| |___ _ _    / __| |_  _ __| |_ ___ _ _ 
 |  _/ _ (_-</ -_) / _` / _ \ ' \  | (__| | || (_-<  _/ -_) '_|
 |_| \___/__/\___|_\__,_\___/_||_|  \___|_|\_,_/__/\__\___|_|  

Welcome to the Poseidon Cluster at WHOI!

Please remember to copy your files to scratch and move/delete them after each job.
Please do not run anything on the login nodes and submit jobs to SLURM. All running 
jobs/processes on the login nodes will be terminated without notice.
```
Congratulations! You have logged on to the HPC! This terminal now represents the environment of the remote computer that you just logged on to. 


>Look at your `prompt`. Has it changed? What information do you see now? What do the different parts mean? Hint: try using the command `whoami` and the command `hostname`. 

### Navigating to our classroom directory
For this class we have set up a special workspace on `poseidon`. This is where you will do all your homework and projects. 

>Navigate to `/vortexfs1/omics/env-bio`. What folders do you see?  Hint: if you are typing out the path provided rather than copying it, try hitting the `tab` key in the middle of the word or phrase, this should automatically complete the phrase for you *or* if there is more than one option repeatedly hitting `tab` will bring up a listing of all options. 

You should see a folder within `/vortexfs1/omics/env-bio/` called `users/`. This directory holds many subdirectories that we will be using in the class. 

### Unix Tutorial: Absolute vs. Relative Paths

This repository contains a practice folder structure for learning basic Unix commands.  
In this example, we will explore the difference between **absolute paths** and **relative paths**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Absolute Path

An **absolute path** gives the *full address* of a file or folder, starting from the root `/`.

For example, if this repo is in your home directory (`/home/student/`),  
the absolute path to `lion.out` is:

```bash
cat /home/student/unix-folders-master/data/lion.out
```

Absolute paths work from anywhere in the filesystem, because they always point to the same place.

üõ†Ô∏è Relative Path

A relative path starts from your current location (working directory).

If you are inside unix-folders-master:
